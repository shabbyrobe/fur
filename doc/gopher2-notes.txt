- Should prescribe use of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606 '.invalid' TLDs
  for dummy hostnames in 'error' or 'info' dirents for something to be valid
  GopherII.

- Connection re-use. If Content-Length is used or the dot is decoded, the
  connection should be re-usable. Gopher over TLS in Australia is horrendous if
  the handshake has to be re-negotiated every time because the protocol doesn't
  provide for connection re-use by enforcing the dot.

- CR/LF: this is overprescribed for textual content. It's an easy detail to
  miss, and a lot of gopher scripts just hoof whatever file they find over the
  wire without even bothering to dot-encode. CR/LF and LF should both be
  allowed. If servers _should_ use CR/LF, but clients have no choice but to
  adapt to whatever they get, why prescribe it in the first place?

- Caps file should have entries indicating Gopher+, GopherII and GopherIIbis
  support, this should be in the RFC.

- GopherII selectors are not referenced in RFC4266 (gopher URLs), but Gopher+
  gets liberal treatment. How does GopherII influence RFC4266?

- How does a server know to stop reading when a client sends a body? client
  should close the write side of the socket?

- "It is also possible to retrieve only a *specific* record or range of
  records.  For example, to retrieve only the views and the abstract, a
  client may send:

   <selector>^I!+INFO+ADMIN[CR][LF]"

  What happens if +INFO is omitted? Does the server still send the INFO record
  or not? Presume yes because it says it's mandatory earlier, but that makes
  +INFO in the selector redundant
